## Overview

This is a fully responsive HTML email newsletter designed for **Kasha Decor**, a fictional interior decor brand. Built from scratch using email-safe best practices, it showcases clean, modular code for marketing campaigns, promotions, and customer engagement emails.

This newsletter features a modern layout with a hero section, product highlights, promotional offers, and a call-to-action—optimized for high deliverability and engagement across desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features

- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Uses fluid tables, media queries, and hybrid techniques to ensure perfect rendering on all screen sizes.
- **Cross-Client Compatibility**: Table-based structure with inline CSS for reliable display in major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Yahoo, etc.).
- **Email-Safe Coding**: No external CSS/JS dependencies; all styles inlined where needed. Supports dark mode basics and fallback fonts.
- **Modular Sections**: Easy to customize—hero banner, featured products, discount code spotlight, and footer with social links/unsubscribe.
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight code, alt text on images, and preheader text for better inbox preview.
